**Abstract:**
The Disease Prediction Medication Guidance and Patient Empowerment Platform
This proposal projects the comprehensive healthcare platform, intended to assist users in determining their potential health conditions, accessing relevant medication advice, and managing their overall well-being. It applies machine learning algorithms that help provide adequate disease predictions, which are given when users report symptoms. The patient portal will also be provided- administered as a user-friendly point of access for secure medical history storage, medication tracking, personalized reminders, and health goal management.The site further empowers user engagement as well as improves medication adherence with functionalities that track intake of medication and patterns of adherence. It also integrates local pharmacies to check medication availability, prescription refills, and price comparisons.By integrating both of these functionalities, the platform should enable people to take on more proactive roles in taking care of their health, which would possibly lead to improved medication adherence and general outcomes in healthcare.
